# Create an API for your machine learning models in Python

As a data scientist, I want to make impact with my machine learning models. However, this is easier said than done. When starting a new project, it starts with playing around with the data in a Jupyter notebook. Once you’ve got a full understanding of what data you’re dealing with and have aligned with the client on what steps to take, one of the outcomes can be to create a predictive ML model

You get excited and go back to your notebook to make the best model possible. The model and the results are presented and everyone is happy. The client wants to run the model in their infrastructure to test if they can really create the expected impact. Also, when people can use the model, you get the input necessary to improve it step by step. But how can we quickly do this, given that the client has some complicated infrastructure that you might not be familiar with?

For this purpose you need a tool that can fit in their complicated infrastructure, preferably in a language that you’re familiar with. This is where you can use Flask

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It can create a REST API that allows you to send data, and receive a prediction as a response
