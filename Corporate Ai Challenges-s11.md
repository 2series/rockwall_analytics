*Many firms are facing challenges in Artificial Intelligence adoption. This where the global Ai market is expected to reach a whopping USD20.83 billion by 2024. Witnessing this tremendous rise when the market in 2017 stood at US$1.58 billion*

## The Role of Artificial Intelligence
The presence of Ai can be comprehended by simply understanding that there is a growth in volumes and varieties of raw data, the different processes, and the need to find an affordable data storage

The need of the hour is to implement a method by which organizations can quickly and automatically analyze bigger, more complex data. Not only this, by implementing and integrating Ai in an organization, it becomes easier to optimize the process. How? Because Ai helps deliver faster, and more accurate results

What is simply required is to build precise and customized models, in which **Rockwall Analytics** can serve as a fundamental assembling point, where your organization can find the best Ai solutions

We provide data analytics solutions for our clients that incorporate machine learning to solve business problems. By using technology to inspire digital transformation throughout markets, we can help organizations go beyond their data to increase revenue, reduce costs, increase productivity, and shifts in financial technology regulations

## Ai Challenges
There’s a lot more to creating useful Ai projects than just training an accurate model! When consulting with clients, *Rockwall Analytics* seeks to understand an organization’s context for developing Ai projects, based on these considerations:

- **Problem**: What framework needs to be crafted that provides best solutions for the user?
- **Strategy**: What is the organization trying to do, *objective*, and what can it change to do it better?
- **Data**: Is the organization capturing necessary data and making it avail- able?
- **Analytics**: What kinds of insights would be useful to the organization?
- **Implementation**: What organizational capabilities does it have?
- **Maintenance**: What systems are in place to track changes in the oper- ational environment?
- **Constraints**: What constraints need to be considered in each of the above areas?

> All companies are different and their journeys are unique. But essentially, the frequently faced issues in Ai by organizations include common issues like:

### Data & Data Security
The availability of raw data is essential for companies to implement Ai. Data is needed in huge chunks to train algorithms. Data of a few hundred samples is not sufficient to train models and implement Ai correctly

However, gathering data is not the only concern. You also need to model and process the data to suit the algorithms that you’ll be using

Data security and ethical implementation of algorithms is also one of the frequently faced issues in Ai. Once a firm has dug up the data, security is a very prominent aspect that needs to be taken care of. Differentiating between sensitive and insensitive data is essential to implementing models correctly and efficiently

Organizations are required to store sensitive data by encrypting such data and storing it in other servers or a place where the data is fully secured. Less confidential data can be made accessible to trusted members of the team - stakeholders, developers, designers, and even users

### Infrastructure for Testing & Experimentation
Ai requires proper infrastructure which is essential for data modeling and reusability. Proper infrastructure aids the testing of different tools. Frequent tests should also be allowed to develop the best possible and desired outcomes, which in turn, assist in creating better, stout, and manageable results

The *stratification* method is usually used to test algorithms. In this method, we draw a random sample from the dataset which is a representation of the true population. The common practice is to divide the dataset in a stratified fashion

> Stratification simply means that we randomly split the dataset so that each class is correctly represented in the resulting subsets — the training and the test set

### Rigid Business Model
Ai requires a firm to be agile in their policies. Implementing models efficiently requires organizations to be flexible with their infrastructure, their mindset, and also requires proper and relevant skill sets

However, implementing Ai doesn’t guarantee success. Experimentations need to be done if one idea is not working. For this, agile and flexible business processes are crucial. Flexibility and rapid experimentations are the solution to rigid monoliths

If one of the model strategies doesn’t work, it enables the firm to learn what is required and consequently guides them in building a new and robust design. The willingness to adapt to failures and learn from them greatly increases the firm’s chances of successful Ai adoption

### Talent
While the number of machine learning enthusiasts has increased in the market, it’ll still take a while for the same numbers to reflect on the number of machine learning experts

Firms are gradually realizing the avenues Ai can open up for them. As a result, the demand for experienced data scientists has skyrocketed. And so have their compensation. Job sites list data scientists as one of the highest paying jobs of 2020. With more and more firms getting on board with big data, Ai and data science, this demand is only going to increase in the coming years

One path firms are taking to overcome this challenge is collaboration. Organizations are partnering up with firms that have the expertise and the experience to harness the power of Ai and implement the offerings to suit the organization’s business goals

### Time-Consuming Implementation
Patience goes a long way in ensuring that your efforts bear fruits. And this cannot be truer for Ai. Firms that implement models usually expect it to magically solve all their problems and start bringing in profits from the get-go

Implementing models is a lot more complicated than traditional software development. An Ai project is usually full of uncertainties. It involves gathering data, processing the data to train the algorithms, engineering the algorithms, and training them to learn from the data which suits your business goals

It involves a lot of intricate planning and detailed execution. And yet, due to multiple layers and the usual uncertainties regarding the behavior of the algorithms, it's not guaranteed that the time estimated by your team for machine learning project completion will be accurate. Therefore, it's very important to have patience and an experimentative approach while working on Ai projects

### Affordability
If you’re looking to adopt Ai, you'll require Data Engineers, a Project Manager with a sound technical background. In essence, a full data science team isn’t something newer firms or start-ups can afford

As a result, employing Ai method can be extremely tedious, but can also serve as a revenue charger for a firm. However, this is only possible by implementing Ai in newer and more innovative ways. Adopting Ai is only beneficial if there are different plans, so regardless of one plan not performing up to the desired standards, the other can be put into action. *Getting a glimpse into which algorithm would suit an organization is the only issue that one needs to get by*. Once you get the best algorithm with which you’re achieving the required outcomes, you shouldn’t stop experimenting and trying to find better and more innovative algorithms

> With a shared perspective and sign-off on the ultimate purpose of the product Ai, the modeling process can run more efficiently. There will always be inevitable tangents and dead ends in innovative Ai projects, but even these learnings can be more insightful when everything is driven by finding a solution to a single problem

Budgeting as per different milestones in the journey works out well to suit the affordability of the organization. Working from a shared understanding of Ai needed to be solved can also prevent public embarrassment — apart from a failed Ai product

As an Ai solutions provider, we at *Rockwall Analytics*, help you reap the benefits of Ai in line with your business goals. We focus on architecting and developing systems that include data ingestion, data processing, algorithm development, and machine learning model development and deployment
