        "# Overview\n",
        "**Financial distress** is the condition wherein a firm cannot generate revenue and meet its financial obligations to its creditors or lenders. If financial distress cannot be relieved, it may lead to bankruptcy, which in turn leads to liquidation or reorganization of the firm. \n",
        "\n",
        "> *There can be many internal and external reasons for corporate financial distress*\n",
        "\n",
        "Budgeting is a crucial factor for an organization to make sure that they are not going to incur losses and are financially safe and secure. Constant losses and the inability to break-even indicate that a firm cannot sustain from its internal funds and hence, raising capital externally will be the only survival option. Identifying these reasons in early stages will enable firms to draft remedies and strategies to turn things around\n",
        "\n",
        "The ability to predict financial distress is of utmost importance for the firms. Predicting the difficulties in liquidation and the consequent financial distress will help them increase their potential, maintain/increase their current investors, and maximize their stock value\n",

        "# Problem Statement\n",
        "The rapidly developing capital markets and the integration of the global economy have drastically increased the number of financially distressed companies. Usually, it is gradually revealed about the company’s entry into a financial crisis after a worse process of financial situation. Hence, there exists a scope of predictability. *The unfavorable consequences of corporate financial failure and bankruptcy are innumerable*. Management, employees, stakeholders, etc always stay concerned with their company’s financial health\n",
        "\n",
        "> There exists a necessity of establishing a **financial distress prediction system** to identify and predict the reasons responsible for the distress caused. Such predictions will help management to forecast the operations based upon the predictions provided, timely management of strategies and strategic plans, optimizing the investors’ investment choices from the analytics provided, etc\n",

        "# About the Dataset\n",
        "The dataset has various columns that give information on the sample companies, the period to which the data belongs to, etc. The *financial distress* column is the target variable that determines if the company is financially distressed. The value in the target variable, being greater than -0.50, indicates the company to be healthy(0), and if the value in the target variable is less than -0.50 then the company is financially distress(1). The remaining columns are various financial and non-financial characteristics of the past time period for the sample companies that can be considered for predicting if a company is financially distressed\n",

As the company and time do not have any significance in our prediction, we dropped these values for our further analysis. All the masked labels play an important role in our analysis. From the list of variables, we select the variables with high VIF (Variance Inflation Factor), *a test to detect the presence of multicollinearity*\n",
