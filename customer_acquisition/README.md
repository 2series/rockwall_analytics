Acquisitions is a very critical function for any organization to drive its growth and sustainability. The growth is in terms of a broader customer base that

First we'll take a look at certain qualitative and quantitative measures that will help us reach the right customer

>Profitability is the long-term gains that the company receives from the engagement of the customer and utilization of the product. Using Predictive Analytical methods, we can assess the long-term gains that the company would receive from a prospect based on an assumption that he accepts the product. In Case of Retail Banking the existing customer data and Data from different credit bureau helps in predicting the profitability more accurately

>Loyalty is the duration for which the customer stays with you. The longer a customer stays, higher are the chances of realization of the long-term profitability that was predicted for during acquisition. Loyalty also impacts stability of a product’s portfolio overall. Based on existing customer attrition patterns an analyst tries to predict the duration for which the prospect would stick with the product

>Risk is the potential of a customer to expose a company to monetary loss. So, acquisitions team look at potential of their prospects under consideration from this standpoint as well. From a retail bank stand point risk can be termed as inability to pay back loans, Credit card bills etc. The credit ratings and analysis of historical behavior of customers helps in identifying prospects with a minimal risk

## Different Methods of Acquisition
There are several distinct methods of acquiring new accounts. Some are organic ways wherein acquisition management engages in an offer and acquire strategy at an individual level, while some of those are inorganic ways wherein acquisitions management engages in acquiring bulk portfolios. But these ways follow the same measures for evaluating an individual or a portfolio. All require prudent underwriting practices to achieve and maintain sound credit quality

***Some of them are discussed below from a consumer banking perspective***


### Pre-Approved Solicitation
Pre-approved offers account for a sizeable percentage of credit card enrollments. They are marketing campaigns where a firm offer of credit is made to a list of prospects, usually by conventional mail but sometimes by phone or email

The target population can be derived from either a general credit bureau search based on specific criteria or lists developed by the bank using either internal information or lists acquired from third parties or affiliates

### Portfolio Purchases
Portfolio acquisition is the purchase of all or part of a credit card portfolio from another entity. Banks often purchase portfolios to rapidly expand an existing credit card operation, realize the advantages of economies of scale, or diversify product lines or geographic markets. In addition, the cost to purchase a portfolio may be significantly lower than other acquisition methods

### Balance Transfer and Promotional rate marketing
Promotional rate marketing attracts new customers and/or induces new and existing customers to transfer balances by offering a reduced interest rate for a limited time on certain charges and transactions

Banks often offer a balance transfer option as part of a pre-approved or application strategy and often in conjunction with promotional rate marketing. With a balance transfer, a consumer transfers all or a portion of their credit card debt with other entities onto the credit card extended by the bank
